# Dot Files

Personal config files for terminal applications and stuff.

## Rationale

Apply my terminal emulator and VIM settings as smooth as possible regardless of what kind of Shell or OS I'm using. Those may include Windows with PowerShell or regular cmd, Linux with Bash and Mac OS X with ZSH or Bash.

## Installing

### ZSH

git clone https://github.com/othman853/dotfiles.git ~/.othman853

bash install.sh

### Bash: Work In Progress

### Windows: Work In Progress
