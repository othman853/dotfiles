# Dot Files

Personal config files for terminal applications and stuff.

## Rationale

Apply my terminal emulator and VIM settings as smoothly as possible regardless of what kind of Shell or OS I'm using (except Windows).

## Installing

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/othman853/dotfiles.git ~/.othman853

bash install.sh
```
